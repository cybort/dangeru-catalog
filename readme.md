It keeps track of how many replies a post has, and shows the number of new replies in red when there are new ones. It marks a post as fully read when you click on it in the list.

It caches the number of replies on closed posts to save bandwidth

It will also show deleted posts, and if you had seen the post before it was deleted it will tell you the title.
